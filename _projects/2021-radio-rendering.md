For ENGRD2020: Statics and Mechanics of Solids, we were asked to design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height, given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of a fixed length, 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground, and a linear actuator picked from a manufacturer catalog. This project involved sketching, CAD modeling, and mechanical analysis to create an optimized lifting system. 

The final mechanism design included a rigid 1.5 m lever pinned to the ground at x = 0m, supporting a load 1.5 m away ath the end of the lever. The actuator was pinned to the ground at x = 0.05m and to the lever 0.013 m away from the base. Both the actuator and lever were free to rotate about their bases, creating a system in which the upward moment force from the actuator strictly opposed the moment created by the applied load.

For this design, a Tolomatic IMA55 integrated actuator with a roller-nut screw and a 3-stack motor was selected for maximum peak thrust (~2300N). I factored in the dimensions of the actuator to ensure it fit within our design constraints of 150 cm x 50 cm.

I was inspired by this old radio when I made this rendering:
