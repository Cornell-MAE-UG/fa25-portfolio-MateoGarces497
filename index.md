## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/Professional_Headshot_Mateo.JPEG" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University. I’m driven by a passion for leveraging strong leadership and collaborative skills to creatively solve complex problems. My goal as an engineer is to apply what I learn to develop practical, sustainable solutions that improve everyday life and strengthen the connection between people and technology.

I’ve gained hands-on experience through design, teaching, and leadership roles. On Cornell University Sustainable Design’s Mechanical Subteam, I will contribute to the mechanical and structural development of a biomimetic, modular bus shelter system, focusing on CAD modeling, prototyping, and stakeholder collaboration. As a Teaching Assistant for ENGRI 1170: Introduction to Mechanical Engineering, I help students master core mechanical concepts and problem-solving approaches. These experiences—along with my work in operations management, athletics, and performance arts—have strengthened my teamwork, adaptability, and ability to approach challenges with both creativity and precision.
